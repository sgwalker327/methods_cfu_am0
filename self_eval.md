# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
Decently confident! I honestly had a good amount of fun with this one

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I feel alright. I feel like I learned to try not to overcomplicate things.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
How often should I expect to modify methods in a first job? Are they normally more in the realm of senior developers?
